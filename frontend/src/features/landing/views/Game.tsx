                     It’s where masks drop, walls fall, and truth takes the mic.<br></br>
                     You’ll laugh, you’ll think, you’ll feel. <br></br> Cause this is
                     where <em> real </em> talk lives.<br></br> For those who feel too
                     much, say too little, or hold it all in,<br></br>
                     <em>Speak to Me</em> cracks open the silence. <br></br>It’s bold,
                     it’s raw, it’s a space to be seen, <br></br>To say what’s real and
                     feel what you mean. <br></br>In a world that often asks us to hide,
                     <em>Speak to Me </em> dares us to be seen.
