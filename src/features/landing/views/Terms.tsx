               <h2>Purpose of the Play to Heal Hub</h2>
               <p>
                  Play to Heal is designed as a digital ecosystem of therapeutic dialogue
                  and connection games, as well as additional supportive elements, to
                  support emotional well-being, inclusion, and healing conversations.
                  While our tools are based on therapeutic principles, they are not a
                  substitute for professional therapy, counseling, or medical treatment.
               </p>
               <br></br>
               <p>
                  If you are in crisis, please contact your local emergency number or a
                  licensed mental health provider.
